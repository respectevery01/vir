# Chapter 3: Prelude to the Abyss

The battlefield stretched across the infinite void of space, a forest of drifting wreckage illuminated by the cold glare of fire and electrical arcs.

“Enemy ships have reappeared!” The AI’s alert shattered the brief calm.

Mack fixed his gaze on the holographic display. The enemy fleet was unlike anything he had seen before: their ships resembled massive insects. The flagship had the form of a colossal beetle, its surface covered in jagged prism-like armor that refracted starlight into blinding, icy hues. Instead of traditional weapon turrets, the ships sported countless tentacle-like appendages. Each appendage ended in a compact plasma emitter, capable of unleashing devastating concentrated beams at close range.

“This is the ‘Razorclaw-class’ battleship,” Ellie analyzed quickly. “Its armor material absorbs most energy-based weapons, and those tentacles… they appear to have autonomous attack capabilities.”

The tentacles moved with unnerving precision, several of them extending toward Mack’s flagship. As they approached, they fired bursts of bluish-purple plasma beams, weaving a net of light that targeted the shield’s energy nodes with pinpoint accuracy. The flagship shuddered violently as the shield’s energy levels plummeted on the display.

“Activate ‘Microwave Scattering’!” Mack commanded decisively.

The flagship emitted a high-frequency pulse wave, disrupting the enemy’s tentacle control systems. At the same time, allied fighter squadrons launched into action, encircling the enemy ships like a pack of predators.

Through the bridge’s viewport, Mack caught a glimpse of the enemy soldiers. Their combat armor resembled a layer of liquid metal, constantly shifting on their surface to enhance both defense and flexibility. Each soldier wielded a plasma sniper rifle—sleek yet menacing, its barrel glowing faintly blue, indicating it was fully charged.

“These soldiers are incredibly fast,” Ellie said, analyzing the data. “They must be equipped with some kind of neural-response enhancement system. Their targeting can penetrate our ship’s shields, making them nearly invincible on the battlefield.”

Meanwhile, the enemy deployed a new weapon: countless micro-drones spewed from the main ship’s hull, multiplying like cells to form an impenetrable “nano-storm.” These drones moved at extraordinary speed, colliding with allied ships to corrode their armor and inject virus programs, quickly hijacking control systems.

Mack gripped the railing tightly. “Deploy the fleet’s ‘Photon Blade Array’ and focus fire to clear the drones!”

The fleet’s photon cannons fired simultaneously, sweeping through the drone swarm like blades of light. The battlefield was momentarily illuminated with searing brilliance, as sparks and metallic debris scattered across the void.

“The enemy’s main cannon is charging!” The AI issued another warning.

On the display, the enemy flagship’s prow opened like a jagged maw, revealing a spinning ring of high-energy particles within. As the rotation accelerated, a concentrated particle beam shot forth, heading straight for the flagship.

Mack took a deep breath and ordered, “Activate the ‘Spatial Rift Shield’ immediately.”

The shield unfolded just in time, absorbing the particle beam’s impact. Space itself seemed to ripple and tear apart under the strain, the violent energy waves making the ship lurch like a battered vessel in a storm.

“We held!” Ellie exhaled with relief, though her face remained tense. “But they’re closing in.”
