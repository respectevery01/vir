# **Chapter 6: Sparks in the Abyss**

The flames of war tore through the galaxy, leaving scars across the vast expanse of the stars. Standing by the observation deck of the starship, Mike gazed at star systems consumed by the conflict. Devastated planets resembled extinguished beacons, swallowed by encroaching darkness.

Through the starship’s comm system, a chilling message echoed:
“Financial systems in the Seventh Sector have completely collapsed. All reserve assets are frozen. Credit networks can no longer sustain material supply chains.”

Beyond the battlefield, decentralized financial systems quietly emerged. Once dismissed as experimental, blockchain technology now formed the galaxy’s last vestige of order. Like an unyielding flame, it weathered the chaos, cutting through data storms and warfronts to allocate resources to ships and colonies in desperate need.

Mike’s Decision
Summoned to the fleet’s command room, Mike was presented with an encrypted file. Its title was concise yet ominous: “Earth Ruins—Project Restart.” The mission brief required him to escort a top-secret cargo through enemy territory to Earth’s ancient remains.

“Earth? Haven’t we abandoned it long ago?” Mike questioned with a frown.
“Yes,” the captain replied solemnly, “but now, it’s our last hope.”

The Truth of War
As the battles grew more relentless, each flash of a laser beam marked the end of countless lives. During an enemy ambush, Mike witnessed an allied fleet surrender after exhausting their energy reserves. The scene tore at his resolve, blurring the lines of justice in war. It became evident that every side was merely gambling in a sea of despair.

Returning to his cabin, Mike played an old recording from Earth. The video showed azure oceans and verdant forests—visions of another world entirely. Clenching his fist, he realized why decentralized systems had endured. They weren’t flawless but remained the only structure unyielding to war’s totalitarian grip.

Final Moments: Dawn and Shadows
The starship plotted its course to Earth, navigating treacherous enemy blockades that seemed like chains binding every escape route. Yet, aided by the decentralized network, Mike’s crew received covert support from surviving fleets.

“We’re not just fighting for the fleet,” Mike addressed his team. “We’re fighting for a fairer future.”

As Earth’s silhouette emerged on the horizon, Mike felt the weight of an unsettling realization. This mission wasn’t just about survival; lurking beneath it might be a truth far more perilous than the war itself.
